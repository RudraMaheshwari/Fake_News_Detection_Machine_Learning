# Fake News Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project is a Fake News Detection system implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python. It aims to classify news articles as either real or fake based on their textual content.

## Features

- **Fake News Classification**: Classify news articles into real or fake categories.
- **CNN Model**: Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks for effective feature extraction and classification.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Preprocess textual data to improve model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Interpretability**: Analyze model predictions and visualize important features.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow nltk numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```
3. **Download Dataset**:
   - Obtain a dataset containing labeled news articles (real or fake).
   - Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.
4. **Run the Application**:
   - Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `fake_news_detection.ipynb`.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage

- **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and split into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using the provided notebook.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Interpretation**: Analyze model predictions and visualize important features using techniques such as confusion matrices and feature maps.

## Contributing
